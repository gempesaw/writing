Ramen Reviews: 5!
=================

[Oishii][] is around the corner from the Broadway stop on the Red line
where I was staying, and just down the street from one of the bus
routes (maybe 9/11?). It felt pretty trendy inside the restaurant and
I'm glad I wasn't just wearing a t-shirt.

* **Overall: 30/30**

Before the meal even started, they brought me a complimentry edamame
mousse, with a single edamame ...nut? seed? pod? thing on top in a
little shot glass. It came with a cute little spoon and tasted like
edamame ... in mousse form. It was pretty awesome! I ordered two pieces
of standalone sushi that were super over-sized and quite
delicious. The sushi also came with a mystery japanese fruit called
"jamomo?" "jomama?" I couldn't catch what the waiter called it so I'm
just guessing..but that was also delicious.

The ramen itself...well, this place is currently the front runner for
my favorite ramen ever. The pork was unimaginably tender and savory,
and I even enjoyed eating the fatty parts. As a rule, I avoid eating
the fat whenever possible, but the flavor and texture was just so good
that I wanted to eat the entire thing. It came with an egg (bingo!)
and cabbage, but nothing else like bamboo or seaweed :(. So, gotta
knock 'em a few points for the lack of bamboo. Still, even without the
usual extras, the ramen was amazing.

The only drawback here was that this small bowl was $20! Quite the
pricey place, but worth it when looking for a place to splurge!
