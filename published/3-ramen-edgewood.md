# Ramen Reviews: San!


I met Karen and Lee for lunch at Miso Izakaya, a Japanese restaurant
down on Edgewood. They only serve ramen for lunch, and there's only
two options on the menu: shoyu and tonkotsu. Karen and I had been
there for dinner a few days before and we weren't impressed, but we
were optomistic for the ramen, having heard great things from our
friends about the place.

* Pork: 2 / 10
* Noodles: 5 / 10
* Everything else (broth, seaweed, bamboo, egg, etc): 2 / 10
* **Overall: 9/30**

I went with Shoyu, but I made the wrong choice. I thought it would be
a darker, saltier broth, as I've been translating shoyu roughly to soy
as in sauce. What I got is pictured above - the broth was basically
chicken soup. There was only one slice of pork shoulder, and it was
tough and chewy with little flavor. The noodles were passable, but no
really noticeable - a bit reminiscent of instant noodles actually. The
saving grace of this bowl was the bamboo, which were a delight:
bursting with flavor and a nice crunchy texture. The broth tasted like
watered down chicken soup, but at least they included an egg...

Suffice it to say, I wasn't really into this bowl. Karen and Lee both
took the Tonkotsu option, and their broth was much tastier, although
their pork was of worse quality, being practically all fat. I won't be
taking a long lunch for this drive again :)
