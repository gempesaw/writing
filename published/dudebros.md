> I despise it when people take a small sampling of truly sexist games
  (which I will readily admit exist, and some are legitimately good
  games despite the fact), but the same people choose to ignore the
  huge number of games with amazing, strong female characters.

It's not enough that games with strong female characters exist, or
even that there's an (arguably) huge number of them. As I understand it,
it's the pervasive sexism in the entire industry, manifested in things
like: the actual game characters themselves, like when Microsoft
didn't release a single game with [a female lead at E3 this year][0];
the attitudes executives of industry-leading game studios, like when
they publicly (and incorrectly) opine that
[games with female protags don't sell][1]; the bullshit the few female
devs have to put up with, as seen when the
[#1ReasonWhy hashtag exploded][2], etc.

> I'm tired of hearing uneducated hits at my favorite hobby. True
  gamers, not the common Halo or Call of Duty "dudebros" that make up
  the public front of gamers, are one of the least sexist groups one
  could possibly meet. Many of us, from very young ages, have been
  exposed to great female role models and characters.

The "true gamers" label is disingenuous and doesn't excuse anyone on
either side of it of their behavior. Anyone who plays games is a
gamer, and it's just as ridiculous to say that all Halo/CoD players
are sexist as it is to say that "true gamers" are "one of the least
sexist groups."

I'm going to mostly skip the entire ME section - the trilogy is
probably one of the best franchises in terms of female representation,
but it's still fraught with
[problems, like feministpoints mentions][3]. I'm not quite sure what
the list of female characters is supposed to do for the argument.

> Alyx Vance from Half-Life 2, Half-Life 2: Episode 1 and Half-Life 2:
  Episode 2 is widely considered to be the greatest companion in any
  game, ever. Alyx is not sexualized in the story and is always
  portrayed as a great friend to the protagonist, Gordon
  Freeman. Faith from Mirror's Edge could have easily been taken
  advantage of with her loose clothing, but the developers chose not
  to, to respect her gender and character.

Using Alyx Vance as an example seems to be a double edged sword -
sure, her character is a great companion, but who wants to grow up to
be a great companion? People don't want to be Midna, or Robin, or
Watson: they want to be Link, Batman, and Sherlock. Faith is, as far
as I can tell without having played the game, a great example, but
again, the existence of some or even many good games with strong
female protags and supporting characters has isn't enough to counter
the rest of the industry's rampant sexism.

> Almost every game with character customisation allow males and
  females to be made by the player. I, as a male gamer, often choose
  to play female over males in these places, and so do many of my
  friends. Females are often more convincing as leaders and heroes in
  gaming, and the voice actors often give better performances and
  carry more charisma. Plus, it is always nice for at least one form
  of media to escape from normal sexist tropes surrounding the female
  gender.

Cool! These are nice anecdotes and opinions, but I don't think they
have much bearing on the state of gaming.

> Yes, there are many sexist and/or misogynistic games - Call of Duty,
  Gears of War, and Halo come to mind - but they are poor
  representations of the medium as a whole. Gaming is actually very
  progressive in the image of strong, independent, competent female
  characters, whether in side roles or as heroines. This wonderful
  fledgling medium is getting a far worse reputation than it deserves.

Yes, agreed! Some games have been very progressive with amazing
heroines, and that is awesome. Gaming is an amazing and exciting
medium with so much untapped potential, but to claim it's not sexist
just doesn't hold up.

All that being said, there's nothing wrong with liking and loving
these games and the industry in spite their sexism - it's okay for us
to like problematic things. It doesn't make us a bad people, as long
as we are cognizant of the shortcomings of the game and the
industry. The ME series is one of my all time favorites, but it's far
from perfect in many ways and that's okay! It's paving the way for
better games in the future, and that's what is really exciting.
