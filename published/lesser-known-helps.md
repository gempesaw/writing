I recently came across a pair of lesser known (for me) help keybindings: `C-h c` and `C-h w`. I ran through the tutorial on a flight because I haven't yet and I've been meaning to, and that's where I found `C-h c` which invokes `describe-key-briefly`. It's basically a baby version of `C-h k`, `describe-key`. Instead of popping up another window to tell you about the keystroke, it just puts a short little description in the minibuffer. I think it'll be pretty useful if I can remember to use it to keep from messing up my own window config.

Kind of going the other direction, `C-h w` invokes `where-is` which prompts you for an interactive function and tells you what, if any, keybinding it's attached to. This is pretty useful when I know the name of the command I want to do, but I'm not sure what the keybinding is for it. I ran across that situation with a couple magit commands the other day and I was able to work backwards to figure out the keybindings. Previously, I'd been doing `C-h m` or `C-h b` to get a list of keybindings and then `C-s`ing through that list for the name of the command.

Of course, both of these (and more) are immediately available through `C-h C-h`, and they've been there for the entire time that I've been an Emacs user.
