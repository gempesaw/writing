Ramen Reviews: Ni!

[HinoMaru Ramen][] is in Astoria, NY only a few miles away from
LaGuardia Airport. Karen and I stopped there twice when we went house
hunting up to New Haven, Connecticut. I forgot to take a picture of my
pretty ramen before mixing it all up, but we did get a shot of
Karen's, including the "fireball" - basically a meatball held together
by Sriracha sauce. It sounds awesome, but in person ... it was
actually just as awesome as it sounds (except for Karen, since she
didn't expect her ramen to be spicy...)

* Pork: 8 / 10
* Noodles: 6 / 10
* Everything else (broth, seaweed, bamboo, egg, etc): 5 / 10
* **Overall: 19/30**

The pork here was quite delicious, savory, and surprisingly tender; no
fat to speak of and quite flavorful. The noodles were a bit of a let
down in comparison, but the biggest problem was that they didn't
include an egg! It was an extra $1.50 to add one, so I added two out
of spite. Steal my land, take my life, can't take my egg from
me...pretty sure that's how the firefly intro goes.

A cute place overall in an awesome part of town - lots of foot traffic
and good service, but I just can't get over the egg thing! And, the
eggs they gave weren't soft boiled, just sort of plopped into the
soup...what I'm saying here is you gotta get the egg right, or else!
