# Ramen Reviews: 4!

[Pikaichi][] is a tiny little authentic shop past Boston University
going outbound on the Green line up in ... Boston. There's only 8 two
person tables and a small 4 person bar, behind which the cooks
work in a small maybe 8x8 kitchen. The 2 waiters' process for
submitting an order to the 2 cooks seemed to be the following:

1. Ask the customer what they want
2. Walk back to the cash register
3. Happily shout the order in japanese over to the kitchen 5 feet away
4. The awesome cooks repeat it in unison as if it's their favorite
thing to say
5. The waiter repeats it back to them like I just won the lottery

Repeat steps 4 and 5 as needed until interrupted by the next task.

* Pork: 8 / 10
* Noodles: 8 / 10
* Everything else (broth, seaweed, bamboo, egg, etc): 7 / 10
* Cheater mode cha-shu-don: +2 bonus!
* **Overall: 25/30**

The ramen here was prety much amazing: three slices of amazing, tender
pork, a good chunk of seaweed and green things like cabbage or lettuce
or something, delicious noodles and an amazing broth. I hardly ever
finish my broth or even bother trying, but HERE I TRIED. A little bit,
anyway. I don't know how I missed this, but it doesn't look like they
included an egg - looks like the pork and the broth were good enough
to distract me.

What rivaled the ramen here for me was actually one of their appetizer
dishes: "small cha-shu don". The description didn't sound brilliant -
shredded pork on top of rice - but what an understatement! The pork
had the same tenderness as that in the ramen, but it was cold and
shredded above a small bowl of rice lightly seasoned what seemed to be
teriyaki sauce? eel sauce? I couldn't quite place it, but it was
awesome. The most stressful part of this meal was trying to decide
what delicious bowl I wanted to eat out of - the ramen would get cold
if I left it, but the pork in the cha-shu don would get warm if I left
that alone! Choices, choices...

It's a really cozy spot near BU's nifty downtown campus, right next to
a Green Line stop. It has a great atmosphere with happy cooks and
waiters, and what's more is tht entire bowl was only $8. The flavor
for that price is too good; definitely coming back here next time I'm
in Boston.
