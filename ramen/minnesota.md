Ramen Reviews: Ichi!

[Zen Box Izakaya][] is in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and it's stood the test of
time (a whopping two whole months) as one of my top three favorite
ramen joints ever! Unfortunately we didn't get a great shot of the
ramen, so you'll have to settle for these awkward ones of me. Karen
and I were stopping off in Minneapolis while she attended a conference
there, and on our last night in town we walked through basically the
entirety of downtown to get to this place. It had really cool things
in the bathroom - an awesome sink and a little foot hook to open the
door from the inside after washing your hands!

It's actually been quite a long time so I don't remember too many of
the particulars about the food. The pork was quite delicious, as were
the noodles. The broth ... really, the only thing I remember for sure
was that the noodles were amazing. Nothing special about the other
items that I can recall; a pretty solid showing overall!

* Pork: 6 / 10
* Noodles: 10 / 10
* Everything else (broth, seaweed, bamboo, etc): 6 / 10
* **Overall: 22/30**

We also picked up a flight of sweet sake, which was awesome because it
introduced us to nigori. Nigori is a sweet unfiltered sake, often
(always?) cloudy - very smooth and palatable.
